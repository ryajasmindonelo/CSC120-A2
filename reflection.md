What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I had an idea on how to make the procedurial programming to the object oriented programming because of the MacDonald class coding. I just applied it to this assignment but I was somehow confused so I went to TA hours. I would advice someone who will take this course to go to TA hours, talk to your classmates/friends and you will be good to go.
